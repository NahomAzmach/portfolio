   <p> A highly motivated and driven individual, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at
    Western Washington University with a minor in Biology. Recognized as a high-potential student, I was nominated
    for a mentorship program, which matched me with a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft. This experience enabled
    me to gain invaluable insights into the industry and develop a deeper understanding of the skills and attributes
    required for success. I have experience leading and supervising outdoor excursions for groups of students,
    organizing the logistics of the excursions, and providing personalized customer service as a Guest Services
    Associate at Target. I have also developed skills in reverse engineering, information security, and frequency
    experimentation. My academic accomplishments include earning a Varsity letter in three sports, being a research
    assistant in a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/spiegelresearch/">research lab</a> concerning blood
    coagulation and Factor IX, and <a
        href="https://www.mukilteobeacon.com/story/2020/06/10/schools/kamiak-high-schools-students-of-the-year/20063.html">receiving
        the student of the year
        award for my high school</a>. Through my volunteering, I have had the opportunity to <a
        href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dyhJJbqGbJLBB3BT8">collect school supplies for
        students in need in Ethiopia</a>. I am passionate about utilizing digital resources, professionalism,
    customer service, strategic planning, risk management, adaptability, teamwork, and philanthropy to make a positive impact.
