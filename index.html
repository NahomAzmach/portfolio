        <p> A highly motivated and driven individual, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
            at Western Washington University with a minor in Biology. Recognized as a high-potential student, I was
            nominated for a mentorship program, which matched me with a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft. This
            experience enabled me to gain invaluable insights into the industry and develop a deeper understanding of
            the skills and attributes required for success. I have experience leading and supervising outdoor excursions
            for groups of students, organizing the logistics of the excursions, and providing personalized customer
            service as a Guest Services Associate at Target. I have also developed skills in reverse engineering,
            information security, and frequency experimentation. My academic accomplishments include earning a Varsity
            letter in three sports, being a research assistant in a <a
                href="https://sites.google.com/site/spiegelresearch/">research lab</a> concerning blood coagulation and
            Factor IX, and <a
                href="https://www.mukilteobeacon.com/story/2020/06/10/schools/kamiak-high-schools-students-of-the-year/20063.html">receiving
                the student of the year award for my high school</a>. Through my volunteering, I have had the
            opportunity to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dyhJJbqGbJLBB3BT8">collect school supplies for students in
                need in Ethiopia</a>. I am passionate about utilizing digital resources, professionalism, customer
            service, strategic planning, risk management, adaptability, teamwork, and philanthropy to make a positive
            impact.</p>
